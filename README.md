React Quiz
An online quiz that uses the React Library to test your knowledge of JavaScript Array Methods.

Description
Uses multiple components to pass quiz data (questions, answers, and scoring) in order to make the UI more interactive. Each answer is a button which populates the next question while also keeping score of correct answers. 

I used “How to Build a Quiz App Using React” from freeCodeCamp.com with Chris Blakely as a guide for the logic. I had to develop various alternative approaches, as my app passes state through components and his state is stored locally in the app.js file (see link below for more details).
